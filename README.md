# Unify


##  Description

Unify is an online platform that allows users to easily create and attend events. It is open to everyone, regardless of background or experience, and provides a great way to learn from and teach others. We have integrated a courier API in order to make sure that users are quickly notified of any system updates or changes. Through Unify, users can stay up-to-date with the latest happenings and get the most out of their events.

##  Getting Started

Getting started developing with this template is pretty simple using docker and docker-compose.

```shell script
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nupurchauhan6/unify-client.git

# cd into project root
cd unify-client

# install all the dependancies
npm install

# Launch the project
npm start
```

Afterwards, the project will be live at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
